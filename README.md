# event-planner
HyperionDev Bootcamp project - an app for planning events
To run:
  Install the files to your machine
  In the main folder, run the "Install and run" batch file.
  This file will automatically run the following commands in a command line interface:
    npm install
    npm run dev
  If the batch file doesn't work (probably because you're on mac) then ~get a PC~ run the above commands manually.
